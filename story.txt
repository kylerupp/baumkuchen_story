One day, a very long time ago, I was sitting in the local Biergarten in my Dirndel looking very much like Schneewittchen when when THEY walked through the door.
When "they" walked in I almost wet my dirndel. As they walked in I was enjoying my bratwurst that the biergarten was serving.
It gave me a schnapsidee, I knew I had to make my way past them and up the hauptstrasse as quickly as I could! Well they ended up seeing me and chasing down the hauptstasse. I ran until I ended up at the flughasfen! I hopped out of my BMW and rushed threw the terminal when I almost ran over Gauss!
Luckily, there was plenty of time until my next flight, so I put on my headphones to listen to some musik. That musik was some hard core rammstein.
