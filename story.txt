One day, a very long time ago, I was sitting in the local Biergarten in my Dirndel looking very much like Schneewittchen when when THEY walked through the door.
When "they" walked in I almost wet my dirndel. As they walked in I was enjoying my bratwurst that the biergarten was serving.
It gave me a schnapsidee, I knew I had to make my way past them and up the hauptstrasse as quickly as I could!
